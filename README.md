## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This framework is built around three core entities that work together to create a comprehensive crawling solution:

### 1. Agency
**Definition**: Represents a website or domain you want to monitor
**Examples**: CNN, BBC, Digikala, LinkedIn Jobs

**Key Features**:
- Configure website-specific settings
- Set crawling intervals and timeouts
- Define proxy settings
- Configure notification preferences

### 2. Page
**Definition**: Specific pages within an agency that contain the content you want to monitor
**Examples**: CNN Politics page, BBC Technology section, Job listings page

**Key Features**:
- Define page-specific crawling rules
- Set up filtering and token management
- Configure scroll behavior for dynamic content
- Set message templates for notifications

### 3. Structure
**Definition**: Defines how to extract data from pages using CSS selectors and XPath
**Purpose**: Tells the crawler engine exactly what elements to look for and how to extract information

**Key Components**:
- **News Links Structure**: CSS selectors to find article/product links
- **Content Structure**: How to extract titles, descriptions, dates, etc.
- **Pagination Structure**: How to navigate through multiple pages

## 📊 Example: Crawling Job Listings

Here's how you would set up monitoring for a job board:

1. **Create Agency**: "Tech Jobs Board"
2. **Create Page**: "Software Engineer Listings"
3. **Define Structure**: 
   - News Links: `a.job-listing-link`
   - Title: `h2.job-title`
   - Company: `span.company-name`
   - Location: `span.job-location`
